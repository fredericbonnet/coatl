"   Colibri is an abstract data type infrastructure. It features:

     - Extensible data type sytem dubbed "words"
       
     - Fast and efficient cell-based allocator
       
     - Automatic memory management thanks to an exact (AKA accurate or precise),
   generational, copying, mark-and-sweep, garbage collector  "


WHAT IS COATL?
==============

CoATL stands for "Colibri Advanced Type Library". It is based on the Colibri
library (currently at version 0.14) and adds advanced features not supported by
the latter because of their reliance on external dependencies. As Colibri is 
meant to be lightweight and dependence-free, the goal of CoATL is to host all 
features relying on third-party code, heavyweight or external data, or having 
specific license issues.

At present, CoATL provides the following features:

 - Full support for the Unicode Character Database (UCD) in its latest version 
   (currently 6.1): all properties but character names and aliases are 
   statically compiled into the library in an efficient manner (the final 
   library file is around 800kB). This provides features such as case mapping 
   and folding of individual characters and strings, and UCD property accessors
   on the full range of Unicode codepoints (over one million values).
   
 - Regular expressions thanks to Henry Spencer's regexp package. This was ported
   from the Tcl 8.5 codebase and adapted to use Colibri ropes instead of plain
   flat character arrays. This provides transparent support for fixed-width 
   8/16/32-bit and variable-width UTF-8/16 Unicode strings.


PLANNED FEATURES FOR NEXT VERSIONS
==================================

1. Arbitrary precision integer arithmetics thanks to LibTomMath library 
  (included in Tcl 8.5).
  
2. Improved Unicode utilities.


WHERE CAN IT BE FOUND?
